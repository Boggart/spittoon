Spittoon
========

Spittoon is a comic strip generator. It is an implementation of the [Microsoft Comic Chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Comic_Chat) algorithm described in the paper, [Comic Chat (Reprinted from SIGGRAPH '96 Proceedings)](http://kurlander.net/DJ/Pubs/SIGGRAPH96.pdf).

I wrote this as an experiment to learn Ruby in 2005. I had planned on making an ongoing comic strip, but it turns out that I'm not very funny. I've now released it as open-source.
